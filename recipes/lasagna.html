    <h2> Description</h2>
        <p> <strong> Lasagna </strong> is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with <em> rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and plenty of melted cheese.</em>r
        The hearty filling typically combines ground beef or sausage with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs, creating a savory sauce that is nestled between tender pasta layers.</p>
        <p> Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until golden and bubbly, with the cheese forming a deliciously crisp top. The result is a comforting, flavorful dish perfect for family dinners, offering a satisfying balance of textures and tastes in every bite.</p>
